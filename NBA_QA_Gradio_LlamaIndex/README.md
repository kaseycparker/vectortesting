# NBA Knowledge-base Q&A app using Llama index with Astra Vector Store and Gradio Web Interface

This is a Jupiter [Notebook](https://github.com/kaseycparker/vectortesting/blob/main/NBA_QA_Gradio_LlamaIndex/NBA_QA_LlamaIndex_Gradio_App.ipynb) demonstrating creation of a Vector Store, backed by AstraDB, with Llama index and CassIO, interfacing with an LLM provider, e.g. ChatGPT, as a search engine and text generator. The demo shows using multiple Llama index modules and question answering using the framework. It also provides observability/tracing with Weights and Biases and includes a Gradio Web Interface as shown in the screenshots below.
